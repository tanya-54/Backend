**VideoTube**, which highlights my backend development skills through several advanced concepts.

1. Backend Architecture: I built the backend with Node.js and Express.js to manage essential user interactions, including registration, authentication, likes, comments, and subscriptions. Handling these features required a well-structured server, efficient routing, and customized middleware.

2. Scalable Data Storage: Using MongoDB with Mongoose, I implemented a schema design that supports efficient data retrieval and scalabilityâ€”critical for a video platform that can grow to handle large volumes of content, user information, and interactions.

3. Media Handling: I integrated Multer for file uploads to manage user avatars and cover images, with Cloudinary storing URLs for these media files. This setup optimizes storage and ensures faster media content delivery to users.

4. Security: For secure user authentication, I implemented JWT (JSON Web Tokens) and bcrypt for password hashing, enhancing user data security and protecting sensitive information against unauthorized access. Additionally, I used CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) to secure data exchanges between the frontend and backend.
